    "# Virtual Subclasses\n",
    "Below code shows our strategy for how we can leverage virtual subclassing in order to create separate, possibly unrelated Enums, and still make sure that they satisfy the same supertype. The key is that we can simply register the Enums with the same superclass. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the danger of virtual subclassing is that we violate the [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle), which is usually a bad idea. Thus, we should be careful to restrict the use of virtual subclasses to cases such as this where we don't care about subclasses satisfying the same interface. Instead, making the spread classes count as the same type serves the purpose of telling the static type checker that we are indeed passing an object of the right type (even though what counts is the right type may depend on the specifics of the subclass, and this not defined by a common interface)."

Thus, if we do encounter a case where a given member maps to the same data format, we should instead consider whether we can create a more abstract member that encompasses both cases. If that's not possible/desirable, we may want to dig deeper to make sure it is safe to use duplicate values.
