# Licenses

The code in this repo falls under the [license found in the repo root](../../LICENSE) (as of July 2023, this is the MIT license).

However, many of the examples show how to implement existing examples from common ML frameworks licensed under Apache2 using my OO_ML framework. Many of these original examples are licensed under Apache2. In compliance with the Apache2 license, I include a copy of it [here](apache2.txt), and list any modifications accompanying any reused code.

Note that my main library code in the src/ folder does not contain any such third-party code originally licensed under a different license.
